# Minecraft-Forge-Tag-List
List of tags that are commonly used in forge mods

I have created this list of tags to meake it more clear and easier for modders to find, and no matter if you are writing you mod in Forge, Fabric or MCreator, this tags applies to everyone!

Also if someone want to suggest a tag then feel free to write a suggestion in issues :)

How does they work?

File names are corresponding to its subfolders
so Items.txt will be related to items subfolder

Format here is simple
subfolder_Name/TagName

sub-folders are made to keep everything clean so, you still can make your tag without a sub folder but it is recommended to place them in specific sub-folders just to prevent duplicated entries.
